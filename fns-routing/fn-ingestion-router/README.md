# Router Function for the DEX Pipeline

This README describes settings on dev environment and it is subject to change as the FN implementation continue to evolve.  

	
## Details:
The FN listens for messages on "dev-routing-file-dropped" hub,  generated by BlobCreated event on the data exchange storage account.

The configurations for the destination routes is retrieved from cosmosDB.  
The retrieval query is based on destination_id and event properties from the metadata of the blbb properties.
